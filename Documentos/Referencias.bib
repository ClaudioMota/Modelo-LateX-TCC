  abstract = {This paper presents an approach for improving the effective
              dynamic range of cameras by using multiple photographs of the
              same scene taken with different exposure times. Using this method
              enables the photographer to accurately capture scenes that
              contain a high dynamic range, i.e., scenes that have both very
              bright and very dark regions. The approach requires an initial
              calibration, where the camera response function is
              determined. Once the response function for a camera is known,
              high dynamic range images can be computed easily. The high
              dynamic range output image consists of a weighted average of the
              multiply-exposed input images, and thus contains information
              captured by each of the input images. From a computational
              standpoint, the proposed algorithm is very efficient, and
              requires little processing time to determine a solution}
